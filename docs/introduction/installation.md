# Installation

To use Tyger, you need an Azure subscription and the [Azure
CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed.

The steps for installing Tyger are:

1. Install the `tyger` CLI.
2. Create an installation config file.
3. Install cloud resources.
4. Install authentication identities.
5. Install the Tyger API.

After installing the `tyger` CLI, you will use it for the subsequent steps.

For step (3), you will need to have the Owner role at a resource group or the
subscription level.

For step (4), you will need permissions to create applications in your Microsoft
Entra tenant.

Step (5) does not require either of these.

## Install the `tyger` CLI

`tyger` is a single executable file. To install it:

1. Visit the [releases](https://github.com/microsoft/tyger/releases) page.
2. Download the right archive for your platform.
3. Extract the archive to find the `tyger` executable. Copy it to a directory
   included in your PATH environment variable.

You should now be able to run `tyger --version`.

## Generate an installation configuration file

We will now generate an installation configuration file, which will be used for
subsequent installation steps.

First, ensure you're logged into the Azure CLI using `az login`.

Next, generate the file with:

```bash
tyger config create
```

This command runs an interactive wizard, resulting in a config file saved
on your system. You can retrieve its path with:

```bash
tyger config get-path
```

Review and adjust the file's contents as needed.

The installation configuration file typically looks like this:

```yaml
environmentName: demo

  tenantId: 2dda111b-8b49-4193-b6ad-7ad797aa552f

```

All of the installation commands (`tyger cloud install`, `tyger api install`,
etc.) allow you to give a path the the config file (`--file|-f PATH`) instead of
the default given by `tyger config get-path`. Additionally, the commands allow
configuration values to be overridden on the command-line with `--set`. For
example:

```bash
tyger api install \
  --set api.helm.tyger.chartRef=oci://tyger.azurecr.io/helm/tyger \
  --set api.helm.tyger.version=v0.4.0
```

## Install cloud resources

To create and configure the necessary cloud components for Tyger (Azure
Kubernetes Service, storage accounts, etc.), run:

```bash
tyger cloud install
```

If later on you need to make changes to your cloud resources, you can update the
config file and run this command again.

## Install authentication identities

Execute the following to install Entra ID applications for the `tyger` CLI and
the Tyger API. These are needed for OAuth authentication:

```bash
tyger identities install
```

This command is idempotent and can be run multiple times. You will receive errors if
you do not have sufficient permissions.

For calls to the Tyger API, the `tyger` CLI can use a service principal instead
of a user's identity. If you want to use a service principal for this purpose,
you can use an existing one or create a new one on your own.

## Install the Tyger API

The last step is to install the Tyger API, which can be done by running:

```bash
tyger api install
```

This command installs the Tyger API from the Helm chart in the
`tyger.azurecr.io/helm/tyger` registry, using a version baked into the `tyger`
CLI. Upgrade the server by updating the CLI and rerunning `tyger api install`.

The API's TLS certificate is automatically created using [Let's
Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Testing it out

Log in with the `tyger` CLI using the domain name specified in the config file
under `api.domainName`. For example:

```bash
tyger login https://demo-tyger.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com
```

This will take you through an interactive login flow similar to logging `az login`.

Once logged in, you should be able to run any of the core commands, such as:

```bash
tyger run list
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall the Tyger API, run:

```bash
tyger api uninstall
```

Note: This does **not** delete any database data or buffers.

To uninstall all cloud resources, run:

```bash
tyger cloud uninstall
```

::: danger Warning
`tyger cloud uninstall` will permanently delete all database and buffer data.
