# `tyger-proxy`

`tyger-proxy` is an HTTP proxy and relay server that allows forwarding calls to Tyger and Azure Storage without clients having direct network access or Tyger credentials.

It is not intended use outside of some very specific scenarios so we are not documenting it at this time. It may be removed from this repo in the future.
